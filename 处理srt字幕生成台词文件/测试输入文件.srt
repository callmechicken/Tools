One of the most common tendencies we have when our heart is broken

00:06:53,842 --> 00:06:56,892
Heartbreak will make those thoughts pop into your mind.

131
00:06:56,916 --> 00:07:00,722
And so to avoid idealizing, you have to balance them out

132
00:07:00,746 --> 00:07:03,859
by remembering their frown, not just their smile,

然后因此而大吵一架， 两天没跟对方说话。

you have to use it.
